To consummate the acquisition, the company should have enough cash balance with them. The company must have weighed its other use at the time of using it as medium of exchange. Earnings per share is used to pay off existing shareholder so that merger would accurately justified its increased value.

It would be the right decision to merge when the rate of interest on debt taken is lower as the company will pay lower interest cost. Here, the merger increases the interest cost to $500 million which will get decrease over time.





Step 5 of 6


**3.**

In addition to the factor mentioned above, the factor which cannot be quantified while entering acquisition decisions is culture difference between the companies into merger deal. In one company, management takes all its decisions while in the other company management includes lower staff while making crucial decisions. In merger, this could be difference between the working cultures of the companies. The other factor could be behavior and attitude of the top personnel of the companies. In merged company, only one person can hold top position in the company. Others management personnel should work together to take company ahead in the market. Therefore, this factor must also keep in mind while taking acquisition decisions.

This acquisition is complicated by the lack of consistency between the two companies’ methods of accounting and currency. The impact of above issues on the merged company in the following years of acquisitions are as follows:

1. One company might be using accrual system of accounting while other is using cash system of accounting. At the time of merger, companies should properly discuss about the method of accounting system to be followed in the merged entity so that possibility of conflict would be negligible.

2. 2. The companies must be clear about the way fixed assets will be depreciate in the merged entity. The management will decide whether written down value method or straight-line method or any other method of depreciation follow by the company.
  
   3. 3. The company must decide the uniform currency, whether dollars or pound or euros, to be used to calculate gain or loss of the merger entity. Selecting a currency will impact the earnings and gain or loss of companies. Hence, it should be decided wisely so that it impact positively in the calculation of its earnings.
